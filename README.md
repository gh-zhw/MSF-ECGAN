# MSF-ECGAN

## Project Introduction
MSF-ECGAN (Multi-Source Fusion Enhanced Conditional GAN) is a deep learning framework designed for optical remote sensing image reconstruction. By fusing multi-source spatial and spectral information through a conditional GAN architecture, MSF-ECGAN effectively restores high-quality optical imagery in areas affected by cloud cover or missing data.

## Main Features
- Multi-source remote sensing data fusion for improved optical image reconstruction  
- Enhanced conditional GAN architecture to recover fine details and temporal dynamics  
- Improved loss function combining L1 and spectral angle mapping (SAM) losses
